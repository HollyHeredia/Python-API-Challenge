# Python-API-Challenge
This repository contains homework associated with APIs for data bootcamp. 

The WeatherPy folder contains code to pull a table from the OpenWeatherMap API and use the information to make scatter plots comparing latitude to temperature, cloudiness, humdity, and wind speed. The images of these plots can be found in the output folder.

The VacationPy folder contains code to pull a table from Google Places and make a heat map through Google. We look for hotels after narrowing down the list to only cities with "ideal" weather conditions and add the hotels to map with pins that contain some basic information regarding the hotel. This notebook outputs the dataframe pulled from the API into a csv file.
